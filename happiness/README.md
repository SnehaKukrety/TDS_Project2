# Dataset Analysis README

## Introduction
This analysis focuses on a dataset with 2363 entries and 11 columns, capturing various metrics related to well-being across different countries and years. The dataset aims to provide insights into the factors influencing overall life satisfaction, encapsulated by the 'Life Ladder' metric. 

## Key Findings and Insights
- **Shape of Dataset**: The dataset contains 2363 rows (country-year pairs) and 11 columns including country names, year of data collection, and various well-being metrics.
  
- **Missing Values Analysis**: The dataset has several columns with missing values:
  - `Log GDP per capita`: 28 missing entries
  - `Social support`: 13 missing entries
  - `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 63 missing entries
  - `Freedom to make life choices`: 36 missing entries
  - `Generosity`: 81 missing entries
  - `Perceptions of corruption`: 125 missing entries
  - `Positive affect`: 24 missing entries
  - `Negative affect`: 16 missing entries

  Importantly, `Country name` and `year` do not have any missing values, ensuring robust identification of entries.

- **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation matrix reveals various relationships:
  - `Life Ladder` has strong positive correlations with:
    - `Log GDP per capita`: 0.78
    - `Social support`: 0.72
    - `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 0.71
  - `Perceptions of corruption` is negatively correlated with `Life Ladder` at -0.43, indicating that higher perceptions of corruption may detract from overall life satisfaction.
  - `Negative affect` shows a notable correlation with `Life Ladder` at -0.35, suggesting that high negative emotions might lower perceived well-being.

- **Positive Factors**: Among the variables, `Freedom to make life choices` and `Healthy life expectancy at birth` also showed positive correlations with `Life Ladder`, indicating their importance in determining life satisfaction.

## Visualizations
The analysis may include various visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps to illustrate the strength and nature of the correlations, as well as to depict trends over the years. These visual representations will help communicate the insights more effectively and facilitate a better understanding of the data relationships explored.

This summary serves as a foundation for understanding the dataset's primary characteristics and relationships among the included variables. Further analysis could include detailed statistical modeling and additional visual explorations for a comprehensive overview of well-being factors across nations.
