# Dataset Analysis README

## Introduction
This document summarizes the analysis of a dataset containing information about books sourced from Goodreads, comprising a total of **10,000 books** and **23 distinct attributes**. The dataset includes essential details such as book IDs, authors, publication years, ratings, and various metrics related to user engagement.

## Key Findings and Insights

- **Dataset Dimensions**: The dataset consists of **10,000 rows** and **23 columns**, indicating a substantial volume of data for analysis.

- **Feature Overview**:
  - Primary identifiers include `book_id`, `goodreads_book_id`, `best_book_id`, and `work_id`.
  - Additional attributes cover publication details (`original_publication_year`, `language_code`), book metadata (`authors`, `title`, `original_title`), and rating metrics (`average_rating`, `ratings_count`, etc.).

- **Missing Values**: Several columns report missing values:
  - The `isbn` and `isbn13` columns have significant missing entries (700 and 585 respectively).
  - `original_publication_year` has 21 missing entries.
  - `language_code` has 1,084 missing values, the highest among all columns.

- **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation matrix reveals various relationships between attributes:
  - Strong negative correlations exist between ratings counts (`ratings_count`, `work_ratings_count`, `ratings_1` to `ratings_5`), suggesting that as overall ratings increase, the detailed rating counts decrease.
  - Moderate positive correlations between `books_count` and `original_title`, and between `work_ratings_count` and all detailed ratings suggest that higher counts of books linked to a title tend to gather more ratings.

- **Significant Trends**:
  - The average rating appears to be weakly correlated with several metrics (e.g., negative correlation with individual rating counts), indicating that high average ratings do not necessarily guarantee high counts in all rating categories.

## Visualizations
Visual representations, including heatmaps of the correlation matrix, will be used to illustrate the relationships between key metrics. Additionally, bar charts depicting the distribution of missing values and the frequency of ratings across various attributes will be provided to offer a clearer understanding of the data's structure and quality.
